#This is a [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) project 
## Getting Started
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/) with your browser to see the result.
  
## Developer Note
I am icing this project as of July 21st, 2023. The purporse of this project was for more TypeScript practice and Redux (RTK) with TS.

The only thing that renders is the gameboard but wrangling the CSS is troublesome and I am not a gamedev. 

Maybe I will come back to this but my time is better suited for more full-stack projects. 

However if you are looking for redux code snippet example and some TypeScript this project should suffice.

Also if you wish to continue and branch off, I am open to any PRs as this was just fun small project.
